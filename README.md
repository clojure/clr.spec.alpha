# clr.spec.alpha

A port of [clojure/spec.alpha](https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha) library to ClojureCLR.

From the parent's README:

> spec is a Clojure library to describe the structure of data and functions. Specs can be used to validate data, conform (destructure) data, explain invalid data, generate examples that conform to the specs, and automatically use generative testing to test functions.

> NOTE: This library is alpha and subject to breaking changes. At a future point, there will be a non-alpha stable version of this library.
